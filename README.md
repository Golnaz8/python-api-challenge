## Overview 

The goal of this project was to analyze weather data for over 500 cities and visualize the relationship between various weather conditions and geographic location. The project was divided into two parts:

Weather Analysis with WeatherPy:
In the first part, we retrieved weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API for a randomly selected set of cities around the world. We then visualized the relationship between latitude and different weather variables, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness. The analysis included scatter plots and linear regression to show trends in the data for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

Vacation Planning with VacationPy:
The second part focused on using the weather data to plan ideal vacation destinations. We filtered the cities to match specific weather criteria, such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity. Using the Geoapify API, we located nearby hotels and created an interactive map that displayed cities meeting the ideal weather conditions, with additional details about local accommodations.


## Technologies Used
This project leverages several technologies to process and analyze election data efficiently:

- **Python**: The core language used for scripting the analysis, providing robust support for data manipulation and file handling.
- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, used to handle, clean, and analyze the school and student data effectively.
- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive library used for generating plots, charts, and visual representations of the data, enhancing the readability of the analysis.
- **hvPlot**: An interactive plotting library that extends the capabilities of Pandas and other libraries for easy creation of interactive maps and visualizations.
- **APIs (OpenWeatherMap & Geoapify)**: Used to gather real-time weather data (OpenWeatherMap) and locate nearby hotels (Geoapify) for vacation planning.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive computing environment that facilitates data exploration, visualization, and narrative analysis, making it easy to document and present findings.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Chosen as the preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and managing the project files.
- **GitHub**: Hosts the repository online, allowing for backup, sharing, and documentation hosting, including this README file.
